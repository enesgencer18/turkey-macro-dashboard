## Write post

Inflation is a hot topic for both global and Turkish macroeconomics nowadays. Inspired by Rami Krispin and reverse engineering his U.S. Electricity dashboard, I created a dashboard for Turkey's macroeconomics. You can find a one-month ahead inflation forecast, key monthly macroeconomic variables, and seasonality analyses.

The data and machine learning pipelines are automated via Docker, Github Actions, and Rmarkdown. The dashboard has too many dimensions to cover in a single blog post since I experimented with different aspects. As a result, in this blog post, I focus on the underlying economics and the forecasting method I choose, Elastic Net. In the coming blog posts, I might write on different aspects like flexdashboard, Docker, or a more interesting forecasting method like LSTM using Keras on R.

## Getting Started

First, we load the required libraries and data set.    

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate) 
library(caret)
library(zoo)
library(ggthemes)

load("~/turkey-macro-dashboard/processed_data/processed_data.Rdata")

```

## Dataset

The data set consists of monthly macroeconomic variables. The dependent variable is the Y-o-Y change in CPI, and the independent variables are lags of

  - Price indexes
  - Tendency surveys of the economic agents
  - Production statistics
  - Balance of payments statistics
  - Exchange rate return
  - Month (to take into account seasonality)
  - CPI_Forecast of TBATS model
  
I only included lags to avoid hindsight bias or the "knew-it-all-along" phenomenon. Second, the analysis does not cover the effect of interest rates on inflation. That is only because I have a pre-written script to pull monthly variables. Therefore, I do not want to spend time adjusting the frequency, and the effect of the interest rate is known anyway.

```{r}
forecast_date = as.Date(as.yearmon(today())) + months(1) - days(1)

train_data <- forecast_df %>% 
  filter(Date < forecast_date)

test_data <- forecast_df %>% 
  filter(Date  == forecast_date)

tail(train_data,3)
head(test_data)
```

## Modelling

I use time-series cross-validation to tune the hyper-parameters and evaluate the performance. To learn more details on time-series cross-validation, please visit:
https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscv/

I use a fixed window size. The idea is that the inflation dynamics might evolve over time. For instance, we have observed the increasing effect of the exchange rate on inflation in recent years. However, as a result of the commodity super-cycle, we might see the producer price index come into play. Therefore, a more dynamic modelling structure is ensured by fixed window size.

```{r}
# Construct time slices for time-series cross validation

time_slices <- trainControl(
  method = "timeslice",
  initialWindow = 36,
  fixedWindow = TRUE,
  horizon = 3,
  savePredictions = TRUE,
  verboseIter = FALSE
)

```

Elastic net is a regularized regression technique that linearly combines L_1 and L_2 penalties. In other words, it is a combination of LASSO and Ridge regressions. Elastic net regularization has several advantages in my case. First, there is a very high correlation between the explanatory variables. Notice that I included multiple lags of a given variable. Also, given two different variables might have associations through several channels. Hence, multi-collinearity should be considered. Second, I desire an interpretable model. Third, in my case, it has higher performance (in terms of RMSE and MAPE) compared to more complex models like Random Forest or xgBoost. Considering the advantages I mentioned, detecting sparse variables and shrinking the remaining coefficients make perfect sense.

```{r}
# Train the model

elastic_net_fit <- train(
  CPI ~ .,
  data = train_data[,-1],
  na.action = "na.pass",
  method = "glmnet",
  preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
  trControl = time_slices
)

```

## Results
